I will accept any pull request to this repository, within a few rules:

1. Only two files may be changed, program.c, and README.md.
2. Any changes to the README.md may not change the rules to the project. Any other changes will be accepted.
3. You can only add lines to program.c (you can not remove lines), and all committed code to program.c must result in a file that successfully compiles using the included Makefile.
4. Don't do anything stupid like committing something illegal, etc.
5. Go wild. Program.c can do whatever you want.
